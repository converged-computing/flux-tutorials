# Flux Tutorials

> A Dinosaur Tutorial Series! 

## Tutorials

- [flux-in-slurm](tutorial/flux-in-slurm): Bring up a Flux instance (in user-space) in a Slurm Allocation - both in Kubernetes ([video](https://youtu.be/8ZkSLV0m7To?si=WqWKCe2jvRuTXvlJ)) 
- [Flux on AWS](tutorial/aws): Deploy an entire Flux Framework cluster to "bare metal" instances on AWS with (essentially) two `make` commands - one to build with packer, and one to deploy with Terraform ([video](https://youtu.be/LJh-ab6fAqE?si=dIzScA530N7lXs_7))
- [Flux on Azure](tutorial/azure): Deploy Flux Framework on Azure with Infiniband
- [Flux on Google](tutorial/google): Deploy Flux Framework on Google Cloud ([video](https://youtu.be/-EUE7Q6OI-8?si=F1UuFMRc71ddifDZ))
- [HPCIC Tutorial 2024](https://youtu.be/Dt4CSZWSEJE?si=b2O7lQrJixcKh-EJ)

## What is this?

This repository is a response from user-feedback that you wanted to have different content for our Flux Tutorials, including us walking through content, and comparisons with Slurm. I hear you! In response to that, I've decided to have a little fun, and to make these shorter or "bite sized" tutorials. I'm aiming for 10-15 minutes per video, and I'll make a set of scoped topics around Flux, along with videos at your request. These will be released when I think of fun new things to share about Flux, or if you have an idea. My goal is to teach you about Flux and have fun along the way.

## What about the HPCIC Tutorial Series?

We still host our official tutorial once a year! For the official tutorial, we give a longer talk followed by hosting an autoscaling Kubernetes cluster where you get an interactive notebook. If you are looking for this official tutorial material, you can find it at [flux-framework/Tutorials](https://github.com/flux-framework/Tutorials) and the latest video is [here](https://youtu.be/Dt4CSZWSEJE?si=b2O7lQrJixcKh-EJ). 

## How do I request a tutorial?

You can [open up an issue](https://github.com/converged-computing/flux-tutorials/issues), ping me on a slack (I'm on [hpc.social](https://hpc.social) and several others, usually as "v" or ping me on Twitter or GitHub (I am vsoch). Any way you can get the message across is good! And if you want to participate in a recording with me? I'd love that! Most of these are unpracticed - I put together a quick README document with some commands to run, and then just record (and see what happens). It's easier that way.

## Tutorials Coming Soon...
